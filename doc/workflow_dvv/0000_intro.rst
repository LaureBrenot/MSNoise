**************************************
Workflow: Relative Velocity Variations
**************************************



This section only presents relative veloctity computations part of the workflow,
assuming the :ref:`workflow_ccf` step has been done previously.

You have currently three options to compute the dv/v:

1. MWCS → dt/t → dv/v (3 steps!)

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   ../workflow_dvv/007*
   ../workflow_dvv/008*
   ../workflow_dvv/009*


2. Stretching (1 step)

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   ../workflow_dvv/011*



3. Wavelet-based dv/v (1 step)

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   ../workflow_dvv/010*
